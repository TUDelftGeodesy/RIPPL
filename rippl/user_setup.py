To allow downloads for the SAR SLC's, DEMs and orbits you will need to
create a few online accounts if you want to be able to download these.

The following code will guide you through the process to setup your
working environment.

#%% md

As a first step you will have to create an account for the sentinel hub,
which can be done using the following link:

https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration

Running the next block will ask you for your username and password and checks whether these are valid.
Sometimes the server is offline and the program will not be able to verify your account. In that case you can skip this
step as you can use the NASA server too. But be aware that you cannot use the ESA hub then! You can add your username
and password always manually to the user_settings.txt file.

To do so you will need to create a folder to store:

3. A folder to store the orbit files. These files are used to determine the exact location at satellite overpass and 
is needed to apply a correct geolocation on the ground. 
4. A folder to write the data_stacks you process. 

Or:

1. Define one master folder where all other folders will be created automatically. 

Be sure that you have around 50 GB of disk space free to do the processing!

If you want you can also change the used names for the different satellite systems

To finish the setup of RIPPL install the snaphu software, which is used to do unwrapping. If you are not planning on
doing any unwrapping this is not needed.

On a linux machine this can be done by using the following command:
apt-get install snaphu (add sudo in front if needed)

On a windows machine you could use the prebuild version that is used in the STEP software from ESA. Follow this link:
http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/snaphu/

On a macbook you will have to build the program yourself. You can use the post under the following linke as a reference:
https://forum.step.esa.int/t/installing-snaphu-on-macbook/10969

The source code can be found under:
